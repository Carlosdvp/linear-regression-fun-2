# Linear Regression Visualization

## Using D3JS

*Interactive Training and Visualization*

The goal here is to create a project similar to the one done on the Coding Train youTube channel. In their example he used p5.js for the drawing and rendering, and tesnorflowJS for the Machine Learning.

I will also use TensorflowJS but I will accomplish the task with D3JS.



## What is Linear Regression

Figure out, can we fit a line into a 3d space that approxiamtes all the points the best we can.
While minimizing all the distances rom all the points to the line.

1. We need a dataset (x's and y's)
We'll create the dataset with interactive clicks

2. We need a Loss function > Mean squared error

3. We need an Optimizer - allows us to minimize the loss function

4. We also need a learning rate

The Formula for the line:

		y = mx + b
