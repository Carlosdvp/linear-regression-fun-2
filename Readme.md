# Linear Regression Visualization

## Using D3JS

*Interactive Training and Visualization*

The goal here is to create a project similar to the one done on the Coding Train youTube channel. In their example he used p5.js for the drawing and rendering, and tesnorflowJS for the Machine Learning.

I will also use TensorflowJS but I will accomplish the task with D3JS.
